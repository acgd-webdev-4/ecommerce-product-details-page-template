# Product details page template

## Overview

- *Work only on your teammate’s `ecommerce-pattern-library`*
- Use their designed patterns to create the page that lists all details for a single product.
- You should already have a wireframe and appropriate documentation to complete your task.
- Inside the `pages` folder make a new single HTML file—you don’t need to connect it into the navigation or anywhere else.
- **Use Patternbot’s include system to avoid rewriting or copying-and-pasting the pattern HTML.**
- *You should only write HTML and insert appropriate classes like `.grid` and type sizes.*
- **DO NOT make any adjustments to any other files in the pattern library—the only file you can touch is the product details page.** If something can’t be created you need to chat with your teammate to come up with a solution.
- **The product details page does not get its own CSS file.** If you cannot create the page without writing CSS, talk to your teammate to better understand the patterns you’re supposed to use.
- Remember that Patternbot will automatically add all your CSS files to the top of the page. This is exactly why it’s super important that your patterns do not target HTML tags directly because at this point there **will** be collisions.
- *Run your pattern library through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

## Pattern library updates

If you run into a situation where your teammate needs to update their pattern library to add something new or fix something, get in touch with teacher to learn how to pull those new changes into your cloned pattern library.

**This shouldn’t happen though—because everybody has thought ahead and made ready everything necessary for the product details page.**

## Hand in

During the next class you and your teammate will integrate the new page into their original code.

Show the teacher the completed version after the integration.
